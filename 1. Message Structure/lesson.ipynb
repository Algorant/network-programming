    "\n",
    "Lastly, let's parse the 3 payload-related portions of the message: \"length\", \"checksum\", and \"payload\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../images/message-structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these three attributes is to read and verify the integrity of the `payload` -- which could be a newly mined block, or a transaction, or a list of peer IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Payloads vary in length. A [`verack` message](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#verack) has empty payload. A [`block` message](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#block) payload may contain a thousand transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with the varying payload sizes, messages always include a `length` parameter which tells us exactly how large the payload is. This helps us avoid reading part of the payload and stopping in the middle, or overshooting and reading into the next message (like the example above where I read two messages by accident).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we read the payload, how can we be sure that what we receive is the same as what our peer node sent us? That nobody modified the message while it was being routed to us over the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we use a \"checksum\":\n",
    "\n",
    "Checksums are a simple idea: when you send data you also include a small fingerprint of that data. Your recipient can check the fingerprint against the data they receive and verify with some probability the message wasn't tampered with en route.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bitcoin protocol creates such a fingerprint by running a [hashing algorithm](https://blog.jscrambler.com/hashing-algorithms/) called [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) on the data twice and then grabbing the first 4 bytes of the result. How can we be sure this fingerprint is any good? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hashing functions are \"deterministic\": given an input `x`, a hashing algorithm `h` will _always_ produce the same output `h(x)`. Since the output is always the same, the first, say, four digits of the output will always be the same. \n",
    "2. Calculating the inverse of a hashing function `h(x) -> x` requires brute force, you'd need to try about 256^4 ≈ 500,000,000 payload modifications (a byte contains 256 possible values and there are 4 bytes) on average to produce a viable payload modification with the same checksum.\n",
    "3. TCP protocol applies a separate checksum verification to each message! \\[sidenote: [Speculating why Satoshi choose to add a second checksum on top of TCP](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/22887/85335).\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So any attacker who wanted to modify a message payload in transit would need to fake out 2 different checksumming schemes at the same time -- and for very little payoff. Alas, Bitcoin makes no assumptions that network participants are honest. \n",
    "\n",
    "So all of this hopefully goes to convince you that if the TCP and SHA256 checksums are correct, it is unlikely that the payload was modified in transit! The protocol simply makes this too expensive for anyone to bother trying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "The first field of the 3 payload-related fields is the 4-byte `length`. The `length` bytes of the `version` messages we handled at the beginning were `b'j\\x00\\x00\\x00'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the tricky part: What number do those bytes represent? More generally, how do we turn numbers into bytes and bytes into numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a question of \"type conversions,\" \"serialization,\" or \"encoding\". The TCP protocol only lets you send numbers between 0 and 255. But our messages almost always need to be more expressive than just a number between 0 and 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we must define rules for conversion of every type of Python data to and from the universal TCP-compatible format `bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such rules were at work in this magical, unexplained line of code in the `read_message` function we defined earlier:\n",
